Automating the workflow ensures the output is readily modifiable and available to stakeholders. Careful planning is required to use the appropriate EO data, programming software, and output formats.   <br>\n",

        "\n",
        "If you google search **Earth Observation**, one of the definitions is that:\n",
        "\n",
        "*Earth Observation (EO) is the process of gathering information about the Earthâ€™s surface, waters and atmosphere via ground-based, airborne and/or satellite remote sensing platforms.*\n",
        "\n",
        "The data collected from EO platforms have wide applications, including natural disaster management, urban planning, weather and climate monitoring, land use and land cover monitoring, food security, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "From the definition, EO data can be collected from different platforms. However, the unit mainly explores EO data collected through satellites, which is the most cost-efficient, especially non-commercial satellites.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Satellites\n",
        "\n",
        "Satellite missions have catapulted the preponderance and availability of EO data, providing substantial opportunities for stakeholders. The popular satellites producing data for public use are Landsat and Sentinel.\n",
        "Landsat has been running since the early 70s, while the Sentinel satellites have operated since 2013. Watch this YouTube video on the brief history of Landsat satellites:\n",

        "## Earth observation data programming\n",
        "\n",
        "Earth observation data programmers are highly sought-after people in many industries. So, what is Earth Observation Data Programming? Again, you may see multiple definitions if you look this up online. The commonality in the definitions is that EO data programming is an intersection of EO science and computer programming.\n",

        "### Attributes of EO data programming\n",
        "\n",
        "- Sourcing EO data\n",
        "\n",
        "EO data is plentiful, but not all is available at zero fee or for purchase. Thus, an EO data programmer should know where to obtain EO data, especially freely available ones. Luckily, many of the portals for satellite data are open source and free for teaching and research. These EO data portals include USGS, Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, and Google Earth Engine. If the study area is in Australia, analysis-ready satellite imagery can be obtained from the National Computational Infrastructure.\n",

        "Exploring the data portals\n",
        "\n",
        "You can explore the data portals anonymously or using a registered account. However, it is recommended that you create an account if you are a new user to leverage the resources fully. Existing users may log in to their accounts to use the portal. The user interface of the EO data portals is different in design but similar in function. Regardless of the portal in question, you almost always require the geometry of your study area (a point or polygon), the sensor, and the acquisition dates of interest. The portal allows users to manually draw the geometry or go to their local computers to upload the geometry, denoting the study area, into the portal. The portals have drop-downs for selecting the satellite (or dataset) and slots for specifying the date range (start and end dates). Options for filtering the search are usually available to the user. Let's review USGS and Copernicus.\n",
